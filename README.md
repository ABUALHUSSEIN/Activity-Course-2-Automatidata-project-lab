# 📊 AutomatiData Project Lab – Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
✨ "The foundation of every data-driven decision is built on understanding the story behind the numbers."

Welcome to the AutomatiData Project Lab, part of the Coursera Get Started with Python course. This project demonstrates the fundamental steps of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python — including loading data, inspecting structure, identifying insights, and visualizing results.

🧠 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to explore, clean, and visualize a dataset to uncover insights and practice core Python skills. This is a hands-on, beginner-friendly data science project designed to:

Apply data wrangling techniques using pandas

Generate summary statistics and descriptive insights

Practice real-world data interpretation

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset used simulates a fictional company called AutomatiData, which collects various operational and customer-related information.

The data includes:
